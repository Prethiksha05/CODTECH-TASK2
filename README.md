### BMI Tracker App Overview

**Project Title**: BMI Tracker App

**Objective**:  
The BMI Tracker App helps users calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight, allowing them to track their health and fitness over time. It aims to provide a simple, user-friendly interface for calculating BMI and gives personalized health feedback.

### Key Features:

1. **BMI Calculation**:  
   - Users input their height (in meters or feet/inches) and weight (in kilograms or pounds).
   - The app calculates BMI using the formula:  
     \[
     BMI = {weight (kg)}/{height (m)^2}
     \]
   - The app categorizes the result into BMI ranges (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).

2. **Health Feedback**:  
   - Based on the BMI result, the app provides health recommendations and advice (e.g., "consult a healthcare professional" for underweight or obese users).

3. **Tracking**:  
   - Users can save and view their BMI history, making it easier to track progress over time with graphs or charts.

4. **Unit Conversion**:  
   - Option to switch between metric (kg, m) and imperial (lbs, ft) units.

5. **User-friendly Interface**:  
   - Clean, intuitive design with easy-to-use input fields and clear BMI results.

### Technologies:
- **Frontend**: React Native or Flutter for mobile; HTML/CSS/JavaScript for web.
- **Backend**: Firebase or SQLite for data storage.
- **Analytics**: Firebase or Google Analytics for tracking usage.

### Conclusion:  
The BMI Tracker App is a simple yet effective tool for users to monitor their BMI and receive health feedback, with additional features for tracking progress and personalizing their health journey.
